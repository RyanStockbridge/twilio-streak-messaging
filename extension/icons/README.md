# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these using any image editor. For a simple placeholder:

1. Use a tool like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
2. Create squares with the dimensions above
3. Add a simple logo/icon (e.g., a message bubble with a phone)
4. Export as PNG files with the exact names above

Or use an online icon generator like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://icon.kitchen/

Until you add real icons, the extension will still work but may show a default icon in Chrome.
